# Private Grok Client

It didin't make sense to me to pay $30 a month for Grok, or any other LLM for that matter, when the token cost is so low. Or pay the same cost every month even when I dont use it. Also why use a third party and be dependent on them for features and performance. So this is what I came up with, it's basic, but hell, do what ever you like with it.

## Install
  Just run `make install` like a grown-up. Set your secrets in `.env`, run `make` and deploy wherever you like.

## Contributors
I don't care, don't botter me with this it's not important, do your thing.

## License
 You know the drill.
